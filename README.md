# Sidekick platform

The new AIO platform for running your healthcare web-apps on desktop.

Modern and lightweight boilerplate built with electron, typescript and webpack.
This project uses .nvmrc.

## Major technologies

- [Electron 13](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- [Node.js 14.17.1](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/)
- Typescript and Prettier are used to improve the developer experience

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

2. Go to project root and run

```sh
nvm use
```

- If you don't have nvm installed, make sure you install it before

3. Install dependencies using yarn.

```sh
yarn
```

4. Run with live reload server

```sh
yarn start
```

### Bluejay

When pulling new changes to `bluejay` (the native module associated with Sidekick),
you will need to run `yarn upgrade bluejay` in the root directory to force `yarn`
to build and use new changes to that package. This is something that we should
improve in the future.

## Packaging
